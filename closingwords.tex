\chapter{Get going, and get in touch!}
We hope you’ve been inspired by what you’ve read so far. The authors of this cookbook are excited to help you make outreach happen in your communities so that, together, we can build a bigger, better and more diverse free software movement!

Get going with your outreach, and get help from us! For quick questions, find us on IRC at \#openhatch on irc.freenode.net, drop us an email at hello@openhatch.org or join the larger conversation on the Events discussion list\footnote{\url{http://lists.openhatch.org/mailman/listinfo/events}}. We’re looking forward to working with you!
